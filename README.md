## Text-Analytics-Cases

# Customer Brand Preferences using MDS Plots:
In this case we are analytics consultants to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager. Our job is to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations. We use cars as an example of a “high involvement” good (recall from class discussions that for high involvement goods, people use social media heavily for awareness building and research).

Process
Extract the messages from a general car consumer forum using 'Selenium'

Calculate the number of co-mentions between different brands and plot the lift values in a MDS plot

Create a list of key attributes the consumers are discussing about by looking at the discussions

Look into how all of the brands are mentioned together with each of these attributes and identify specific patterns if any

Using our insights from this analysis, we make recommendations to different people on areas of improvement and provide awareness about competitors
