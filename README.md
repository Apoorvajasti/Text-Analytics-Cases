# Text-Analytics-Cases

## Customer Brand Preferences using MDS Plots:
In this case, we worked as analytics consultants to a (i) brand manager, (ii) product manager and (iii) advertising manager. Our job was to give advice/insights to these individuals based on the analysis of social media conversations of the product. We used cars as an example of a “high involvement” goods (As for high involvement goods, people use social media heavily for awareness building and research).

Process
1. Extracted about ~5000 messages from a general car consumer forum using 'Selenium'
2. Calculate the number of co-mentions between the different brands and plotted the lift values on a MDS map
3. Created a list of key car attributes the consumers are discussing about
4. Looked into how the brands are mentioned together on each of these attributes and identified aspirational brand
5. Used insights from this analysis to make recommendations to different stakeholders on areas of improvement and provided awareness about competitors
